# rules of optimization
# 1 - DON'T it's probably fast enough
# 2 - Don't yet, developer time is expensive, it may be worth just ugprading the hardware
# 3 - Profile first, then optimize

## TIPS
# use real data when profiling
# run on production like environment
# turn off anti-virus
# have a test suite
# known when to measure - be aware of warm up time

# look at entire system and identify bottlenecks
# take a lookt at the strace
